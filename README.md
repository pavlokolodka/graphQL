# GraphQL Project

This is a project created for training purposes to better understand GraphQL.

## Overview

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by Facebook. It provides a powerful and flexible way to define, query, and manipulate data. GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving performance.

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with GraphQL. It includes sample code for creating a GraphQL server and defining a schema, as well as sample queries and mutations.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

- `express-graphql`: The GraphQL server using Express.js and express-graphql package. ⚠️ Deperecated, use `graphql-http` instead.
- `apollo-server`: The GraphQL server using Express.js and appolo-server package.
- `products.json`: This file serves as a dummy database.
